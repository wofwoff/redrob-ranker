"""Exact-match tier map for the 44 career-history description templates.

The entire 100K pool's 300,171 career-history roles are built from exactly 44
distinct description strings (each reused ~6,800x; none unique). The dataset author
hand-tiered them: usage frequency falls by orders of magnitude from generic (25K
uses) to elite (2-12 uses), and the rarest read almost verbatim from the JD
("NDCG/MRR/recall@K", "hybrid BM25 + dense retrieval", "candidate-JD matching").

So the description a role carries is a near-ground-truth signal of how JD-relevant
that role actually was -- far sharper than keyword matching, which cannot tell
"recommendation-style features, lighter than FAANG" (tier 2) from "RAG ranking
pipeline serving 50M queries/month with NDCG/MRR/recall@K" (tier 5). We hand-tiered
all 44 by JD-relevance (0 = non-technical .. 5 = elite retrieval/ranking at scale),
informed by content and corroborated by the author's own rarity signal.

A read-only cross-tab confirmed this is SAFE: tier >= 3 descriptions occur under
strong-ML current titles ONLY (zero leakage to non-tech), so trusting the
description carries no keyword-stuffer/honeypot risk. Unknown text -> tier_for()
returns None and callers fall back to keyword matching (graceful degradation).
